Python version of imageQC

v3.0.0alpha - some functions not finished yet and not fully tested

imageQC is a software-tool for the Medical Physicist performing quality control on medical imaging devices or extracting specific DICOM header data. The software exists in IDL-code, but is currently converted and upgraded to Python code. Hopefully a beta-version will be available at the end of 2022.
