	- Variance now calculated for two different ROI sizes to highlight artifacts of different dimensions.
	- Changed from defining ROI by % of image dimensions to outer margin (in mm).
	- These changes will affect result table. Apologies if you already used this for automation. Normally such changes are avoided if possible.

- In the Advanced open files dialog: option to import saved Tag Pattern - Format for grouping images (including modality specific tags).
- Simulating artifacts:
	- Added option to generate 3d artifacts (not fully validated yet)
	- Added option to set full image to zero before adding artifacts
- Added Variance as test for Mammo. Similar to Variance test for Xray, but with option to mask max-values as for Homogeneity (flat field test).
- Added option in Edit Annotations dialog to turn off overlays. Default is still to include overlay in image. NB - during automation overlay is always on. No option, yet, to turn this off.

Changes:
- Changes to calculations of MTF from line source: more robust on how to interpret the direction of the source 
- Test CT / Slicethickness: Added Catphan 700 option (ignoring vertical ramps for axial and horizontal ramps for helical slicethickness compared to Catphan 500/600)
- Test NM/SNI: When point source correction and using reference image - both the reference image and the image to be analysed will now always be corrected separately 
allowing for difference in point source position.

# v3.1.1
_Aug 07, 2024_

New functionalities:
- PET: Added spatial resolution (MTF) similar to SPECT. Added option to perform line source test with sliding window, listed results pr window (image group)
to allow for more variation over the line source. Tested with Ge-68 line sources for Siemens PET.
- Copied flatfield test (from Mammo) as option to Xray (variant within test Hom).
- Started to add option to read info from RDSR files. SR added as modality with DCM as only test. To be continued for reading structured data.

Changes:
- When copying curves/plots to clipboard, curves sharing the same x-values (i.e. one x-axis pr all curves in clipboard, not one pr curve)
- Added option to simulate gamma camera point source as artifact
- Added option to merge pixels before NM SNI calculations
- Alternative or dynamic headers of results tables:
	- Added validation to output settings vs parameter settings
- Output settings of parametersets more user friendly:
	- When adding new settings - the alternative is set and locked to the one defined in the parameterset (more logical)
	- When editing, the alternative is selectable (for flexibility with old settings)
	- When changing parameters that might affect related output settings - a warning is given.
	- Added to validation test in 'Verify config files ...' in Settings - Config folder

Fixes:
- NM test SNI: v3.1.0 lost connection to reference image, if used. Now restored.
- Adding artifacts:
	- Handeling adding noise when <=0 within noise shape (setting values to 1 if <=0 before adding noise).
	- Better handeling artifact name when editing of settings. Keep autogenerating or keep manually edited.
- Fixed order error in Settings - LimitsAndPlotTemplates when editing templates.
- In some combinations of actions (zoom and also maybe profile plot involved?) the image zoom have been unable to reset by the home button and also the refresh button. 
 Another force reset attempt is added hopefully to be able to reset using the refresh button if this happens. So far not succeeded to reproduce the situation.
- Fixed crash when Dicom Dump used in combination with replace_import script.
 

# v3.1.0
_Jun 21, 2024_

Dependancies:
- avoided numpy > 2.0 newly released. Will need some validation and probably migration 

Changes:
- Dialog to add artifacts with improved functionalities, including option to save artifacts to file for reuse.
- Added option to change angle of ramp for CT slice thickness if other phantoms used. Also added default settings for GE phantom with horizontal wire ramps (angle 45degrees).
- NM SNI:
	- Option to let SNI be ratio between integrals of 2d NPS or radial profiles, ignoring negative values. Significant difference and clearly more sensitive with latter testing with simulated artifacts.
	- Option to choose whether point source correction with reference image should fit position to reference image or current image, avoiding artifacts to affect the fit.
	- Option to design low/high filter instead of human visual filter. Experimental purpose.
- Selected image index now displayed when working with QuickTest templates in the Settings manager (benefit if working with more than a few images).

Bugfixes:
- Some MR tests failed finding ROI if high signal at image borders. This resulted in program crash.
- Some issues finding center of object within ROI fixed = improved/fixed CT MTF from circular edge with low contrast and finding phantom position for PET Recovery curves.
- Avoiding crash when setting window level from active rectangle and rectangle dragged in other direction than top-right ot lower-left

# v3.0.9
_Jun 11, 2024_

Dependancies:

Changes/fixes:
- Test NM SNI: option to ignore low frequency by modifying the human visual response filter 
- Method get_radial_profile corrected by half a pixel to reflect the center position of the pixels, not the corner of the pixels. This method is used when calculating the radial profiles of NPS, test Radial profile and SNI. The change might slightly affect the results of these tests.
- Added tag 0008,0033 (Content Time) as alternative to AcquisitionTime if tag 0008,0032 is missing.

	- default templates updated with larger ROIs to handle these day to day changes, ignoring parts of text at left/right border of ROI
- Changed startup time (saved some update after gui presented)
- CT test Slice thickness:
	- Added option to median filter profiles before finding the FWHM (for noisy images - better option is probably to increase mAs)
- NM test Uniformity and SNI:
	- Searching for non-zero image now also ignore neighbour row/column of zero values according to NEMA NU-1 (i.e. smaller found active image by 1 pixel each direction)
	- Uniformity:
		- Several changes speed up and to get closer to NEMA NU-1. This highly affect the results with UFOV ratio close to 1, else minimal effect (as intended).
		- Added option to cut the corners as the largest errors in ufov often are found there which is generally not clinical relevant.
		- Default ufov_ratio is changed from 0.95 to 1
		- Added to supplement result table: scaled pixel size + center pixel count (after scaling)
		- Added warning if center pixel < 10000 (NEMA minimum)
	- SNI:
		- Added option to calculate SNI based on ROIs positioned in grid matching PMT positions for Siemens gamma camera
		- Two large ROIs for all grid options

- Mammo test Homogeneity:
   - Added option to not calculate variance-map (to speed up if not needed)
   - Added option show count of deviating pixels within each ROI to better detect where these are located, list coordinates of these pixels and highlight with circles
   - Added option to set limit for ignoring calculations of ROI if masked pixels higher than the limit (%). Previously always ignored if any pixels masked. Calculations are performed ignoring the masked pixels.  
   - Added option to mask outer rim of given mm.
- Mammo Ghost: Changed default ROI size to 20 mm to get the recommended 4 cm^2 ROIs. Also adjustet default position of ROI_1 by 5 mm.

Bugfixes:
- fixed error when using image names for QuickTest where more images than expected are loaded (IndexError on set_names[i], calculate_qc.py line 158)
- default spinbox maximum is 100. Increased this value for different test-parameters that were not yet specified with max > 100.
- avoiding crash when scrolling through images using arrow keys (therefore skips showing some images as signal is blocked while processing). 
- black and dark gray plot lines in dark-mode changed to white and light gray
- fixed error when using slicethickness test in automation. (AttributeError 'Gui' object has no attribute 'active_img_no'
- fixed error when locking source distance for NM Uniformity and SNI when correcting for point source curvature.

- Automation - functionality to move files out of archive now also include option to sort files by modification time, not only file name. Useful f.x for vendor QC files.

Fixes:
- RenameDicom have had some issues if there is a mix of files and folders directly in the selected path. This should no longer be a problem.
- Fixed incorrect behaviour if extra offset (test ROI and MTF).
- Fixed test ROI
	- tabulated ROIs with same shape - table used to show mm, but ROI effect was pixels if offset set to pixels
	- tabulated ROIs defined individually - mm removed from table headers - this option will always be pr pix, not mm
